- Threat modeling is a structured approach to identify and prioritize potential threats to a system and determine mitigations.

- It's important for developers, designers, and architects to include threat modeling in software development.

- Key terms: threat agents, impact, likelihood, controls, preventions, mitigations, data flow diagrams, trust boundaries.

- Process includes defining business objectives, understanding design, creating information flow diagrams, and classifying data.

- Threat agents are identified, attack vectors are drawn, and risks are assessed using methodologies like DREAD and PASTA.

- Risks are ranked, and mitigation plans are developed in collaboration with risk owners and stakeholders.

- Controls are chosen to mitigate risks, tested, and periodically re-evaluated.
