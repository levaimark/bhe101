Chapter 1 of "Applied Cryptography" by Bruce Schneier provides an introduction to the field of cryptography.
It covers basic concepts, such as the importance of security, the role of algorithms, and the need for secure communications.
The chapter also introduces key historical figures and their contributions to cryptography, including Julius Caesar and Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re.
It highlights the importance of encryption and decryption processes and lays the groundwork for more advanced cryptographic techniques discussed later on.
