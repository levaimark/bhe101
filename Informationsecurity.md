Here are some of my screenshots about me making my debian according tot he link: https://terokarvinen.com/2021/install-debian-on-virtualbox/#first-login 

For homework 1.

I chose https://darknetdiaries.com/transcript/45/ this podcast for homework 1. As I couldn’t appear on the first day of school on your class I had a hard time doing all of these and to recognise what is the assignment really. The podcast was very interesting, and I am pretty sure, that I will be hearing from this podcast crew, due to my interests. It was good to listen to people doing black or white hat stuff on the internet when it comes to hacking. It was also a bit weird that most of these guys in the podcast started their career early in their teenage years. When it came closer to the end of the podcast the things, they were talking about suddenly became more and more interesting, because they were talking about how illegal it became and some of them how got into trouble, like get arrested. This kind of adrenaline rush these guys have experienced and talked out here is a great thing to share with others.

Kill Chain:

-The text explains the Intrusion Kill Chain, a systematic process used to understand and counter cyber threats.

-It breaks down the stages of a cyber intrusion, from reconnaissance to actions on objectives.

-Practical guidance is provided for aligning defensive capabilities with each phase of the Kill Chain.

-The concept of resiliency in defense is emphasized, where continuous adaptation increases the cost for adversaries.

-The text promotes intelligence-driven cybersecurity and proactive, adaptive defense strategies.

Summarize A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration:

-In the latest edition, 90% of applications were tested for misconfigurations, with an average incidence rate of 4%.

-Over 208k instances of Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) in this category.

-Notable CWEs include CWE-16 Configuration and CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference.

-Vulnerabilities arise from security hardening gaps, improper cloud service permissions, enabling unnecessary features, default account usage, revealing error messages, insecure settings in frameworks, outdated software, and more.

-Preventive measures include repeatable hardening processes, minimal platform installation, regular configuration reviews and updates, segmented architecture, 
security header implementation, and automated configuration verification.

-Example attack scenarios involve exploiting default accounts, directory listing vulnerabilities, detailed error messages, and insecure cloud sharing permissions.

Summarize A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components:

-Vulnerable Components category ranked #2 in the Top 10 community survey and also made the Top 10 via data.

-No Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs; default exploits/impact weight of 5.0 is used.

-Notable CWEs include CWE-1104: Use of Unmaintained Third-Party Components.

-Vulnerability occurs when versions are unknown, software is outdated, and regular vulnerability scans and updates are lacking.

-Patch management process should remove unused dependencies, continuously monitor component versions and vulnerabilities, and obtain components from secure sources.

-Organizations must monitor and update components throughout the application's lifetime.

-Example attack scenarios involve exploits like CVE-2017-5638 (Struts 2 remote code execution) and the importance of patching IoT devices, with tools like Shodan used to find unpatched systems.

Summarize A03:2021 – Injection:

-Injection vulnerabilities rank third, with 94% of applications tested and an average incidence rate of 3%.

-Notable CWEs include CWE-79: Cross-site Scripting, CWE-89: SQL Injection, and CWE-73: External Control of File Name or Path.

-Vulnerabilities occur when user-supplied data is not properly validated, filtered, or sanitized.

-Common injection types include SQL, NoSQL, OS command, ORM, LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) injections.

-Prevention involves using safe APIs, parameterized interfaces, or ORM tools, along with server-side input validation and escaping special characters.

-Limiting SQL controls within queries can prevent mass data disclosure.

-Attack scenarios involve attackers manipulating untrusted data to execute malicious SQL queries, potentially leading to data leaks or other malicious actions.

Installing Webgoat:

I did the installization, even though I wasn't sure where to find this: b) F12. Solve Webgoat 8: General: Developer tools, so i didn't did that part of the homework yet, but I will do it after monday's class, when I understand the assignment.

d) Sequel. Solve SQLZoo:

0 SELECT basics

2 SELECT from World, from first two subtasks.

I did all of the 0 SELECT basics and most of the 2 SELECT from world parts, I tried my best on this one.
