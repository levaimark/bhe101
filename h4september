Schneier 2015, Chapter 2.3: "One-Way Functions"
In this section of "Applied Cryptography," Bruce Schneier discusses one-way functions, which are mathematical functions that are easy to compute in one direction but computationally infeasible to reverse.
He emphasizes their importance in encryption and security protocols, such as public-key cryptography, where the difficulty of factoring large numbers is used as a basis for encryption.
Schneier also mentions the mathematical properties that make one-way functions useful in cryptography.

Schneier 2015, Chapter 2.4: "One-Way Hash Functions"
In this section, Schneier introduces one-way hash functions, which are used to map arbitrary data to a fixed-size hash value.
He discusses their applications in ensuring data integrity and security, such as in digital signatures and password storage.
Schneier highlights the properties of good hash functions, including collision resistance and preimage resistance, and their role in protecting against data tampering.

Särökaari 2018: "Phishing through Email" (Video, 33 min)
This video discusses phishing attacks conducted through email, a common and deceptive method used by cybercriminals to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information.
The video likely covers tactics employed by phishers, common red flags to identify phishing emails, and ways to protect oneself from falling victim to phishing scams.
